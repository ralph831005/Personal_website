				<h1>Yen-Ting Lee</h1>
				<p>
					Hi, I'm Yen-Ting Lee.<br>
					I'm a senior student majored in computer science and information engineering and double-majored in finance at National Taiwan University, and now I'm in <a href="http://140.112.31.186/">Machine Discovery and Social Network Mining Laboratory</a> leading by professor Shou-De Lin.
					Currently, my research is about information extraction of papers with the combination of our knowledge base.
					Before this research starts, I participated in <a href="http://www.wsdm-conference.org/2016/">WSDMcup 2016</a> with our lab and won the 8th price. 
					This competition is about paper ranking with given citation graph and co-author ship heterogeneous graph, and we've done some results concluded in our papers at WSDM conference 2016, which is not published yet.

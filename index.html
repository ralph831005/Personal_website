					<h1>About me</h1>
					<p>
						Hi, I'm Yen-Ting Lee.<br>
						I'm a senior student majored in computer science and information engineering and double-majored in finance at National Taiwan University, and now I'm in <a href="http://140.112.31.186/">Machine Discovery and Social Network Mining Laboratory</a> leading by professor Shou-De Lin.
						Currently, my research is about information extraction of papers with the combination of our knowledge base.
						Before this research starts, I participated in <a href="http://www.wsdm-conference.org/2016/">WSDMcup 2016</a> with our lab and won the 8th price. 
						This competition is about paper ranking with given citation graph and co-author ship heterogeneous graph, and we've done some results concluded in our papers at WSDM conference 2016, which is not published yet. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Skills I learnt: C, C++, java, python, html, css.<br>
						Recently, I've developed an online board game, with Yilin Wang using java, javafx and css.
						We designed our own server, client, and gui. It's a great experience in frontend and backend developing.
